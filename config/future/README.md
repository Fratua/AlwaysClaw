# Future Infrastructure Configurations

These configuration files describe planned infrastructure that is not yet deployed.
They are kept here as reference for future implementation.

- `blue-green-config.yaml` - Blue/green deployment strategy configuration
- `canary-config.yaml` - Canary release rollout configuration
- `alerting-rules.yaml` - Alerting rules (actively consumed by alert_manager.py from project root)
- `feature-flags.yaml` - Feature flag definitions (requires feature flag runtime)
